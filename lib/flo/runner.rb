module Flo

  # This is the main class for instantiating and performing Flo commands.  If
  # you are wanting to interact with Flo via a ruby script, this is the class
  # you want.  Utilizing Flo through the command line interface will invoke this
  # class after all of the argument parsing is complete.
  #
  # @example
  #     runner = Runner.new
  #     runner.load_config_file('path/to/config/file')
  #     runner.execute([:issue, :submit], id: '1234', submitter: 'John Doe')
  #
  # @attr_reader commands [CommandCollection] List of commands currently defined
  #
  class Runner
    include Cleanroom

    attr_reader :commands

    # Creates a new runner.  This object is generally useless until you load
    # some configuration into it, typically using {#load_config_file}
    #
    def initialize(opts={})
      @config = opts[:config] || Flo::Config.new
      @command_class = opts[:command_class] || Flo::Command
      @commands = opts[:command_collection] || Flo::CommandCollection.new
    end

    # Open and parse a file containing flo configuration.  This file is
    # evaluated within a cleanroom.  See the {https://github.com/sethvargo/cleanroom cleanroom gem}
    # for more information.
    # @param config_file [String] path to the flo configuration file
    #
    def load_config_file(config_file)
      evaluate_file(config_file)
    end

    # Executes the command specified, with the arguments specified
    # @param command_namespace [Array<Symbol>] An array containing the name of
    #   the command as a symbol, including the namespace.  For example, the
    #   command "issue submit" would become [:issue, :submit]
    # @param args={} [Hash] Options that will get passed to the command
    #
    def execute(command_namespace, args={})
      commands[command_namespace].call(args)
    end
